Coming soon...



Installation
------------
Add the following to your composer.json file:

    "repositories": [
            {
                "type": "vcs",
                "url": "https://github.com/PartFire/CommonBundle"
            }
        ]
Then you can run:

    $ composer require partfire/common-bundle:dev-master
    
Will add to packagist when more functionality.
